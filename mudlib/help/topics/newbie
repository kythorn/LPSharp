                       GETTING STARTED - New Player Guide
===============================================================================

Welcome to LPMud Revival! This guide will help you get started.

FIRST STEPS
-----------
When you first enter the game, you'll be in the Town Square. Take a moment to
look around with the 'look' command to see where you are.

1. LOOK AROUND
   Type: look
   This shows you the room description, any items on the ground, and the
   available exits.

2. MOVE AROUND
   Type: go <direction>   (or just the direction name)
   Example: go north, go south, n, s, e, w
   Explore the town! The exits are listed at the bottom of each room.

3. CHECK YOUR STATUS
   Type: score
   This shows your level, health, stats, experience, and gold.
   Type: hp
   This shows a quick health summary.

EXPLORATION TIPS
----------------
- The Town is safe - no monsters will attack you there
- Visit the tavern (west from Town Square) for drinks that heal you
- The wilderness (south from town) has monsters to fight
- Hidden exits exist! Try examining things carefully

COMBAT BASICS
-------------
1. Find a monster (try the Forest Path south of town)
2. Type: attack <monster name>
   Example: attack rat
3. Combat is automatic - you'll trade blows until one of you dies
4. Check your health with 'hp' during combat
5. If you're losing, you can try to flee (go to an exit)

YOUR FIRST FIGHT
----------------
The easiest monster is the RAT in the Forest Path:
  - From Town Square, go south to Market Street
  - Go south again to South Gate
  - Go south to the Crossroads
  - Go south to the Forest Path
  - Type: attack rat

Rats give 5 XP when killed and might drop a Rat Tooth weapon.

GETTING EQUIPMENT
-----------------
Monsters sometimes drop items when they die. To get equipment:
  1. Type: get <item>     - Pick up an item
  2. Type: wield <weapon> - Equip a weapon
  3. Type: wear <armor>   - Put on armor
  4. Type: inventory      - See what you're carrying

WHEN YOU DIE
------------
Don't panic! When you die:
  - You'll be sent to the Netherworld
  - Your items will be on your corpse (which stays in the room)
  - Type: resurrect - This returns you to town with full health
  - Go back to your corpse quickly to get your items!

USEFUL COMMANDS
---------------
  look        - See the room
  score       - See your full stats
  hp          - Quick health check
  inventory   - See what you're carrying
  who         - See who's online
  say <msg>   - Talk to others in the room
  quit        - Save and exit the game

NEXT STEPS
----------
Once you've defeated some rats, try these progressively harder challenges:
  1. Spiders in the Spider Nest (10 XP)
  2. Snakes in the Snake Pit (15 XP)
  3. Wolves in the Wolf Den (20 XP) - WARNING: Aggressive!
  4. Orcs in the Deep Forest (25 XP) - WARNING: Aggressive!

Aggressive monsters attack you on sight, so be prepared!
