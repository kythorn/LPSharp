GUILDS
======

Guilds are organizations that teach specific skills and abilities. Joining
a guild grants access to skills you cannot learn elsewhere.

JOINING A GUILD
---------------
To join a guild, go to its guild hall and type 'join'. You can be a member
of multiple guilds, though some may have conflicts or requirements.

GUILD BENEFITS
--------------
Each guild grants access to specific skills. For example:
  - Fighters Guild: sword, axe, mace, dagger, shield_block, parry
  - Mages Guild: evocation, conjuration, transmutation

You can only advance skills that your current guilds grant. However, you
keep any skill points already earned even if you leave a guild.

SKILL LEARNING
--------------
Skills improve through use with logarithmic diminishing returns:
  - Early levels gained quickly
  - Higher levels require more practice
  - No hard cap, but progress slows dramatically
