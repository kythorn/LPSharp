MAGIC
=====

Magic in the game is organized into schools, each teaching different
types of spells. You must join a guild that teaches magic to learn spells.

MAGIC SCHOOLS
-------------
  Evocation     - Offensive magic (fireball, magic missile)
  Abjuration    - Protective magic (heal, shield)
  Conjuration   - Summoning magic (summon familiar)
  Transmutation - Transformation magic
  Divination    - Knowledge magic
  Illusion      - Mind-affecting magic
  Enchantment   - Charm and control magic
  Necromancy    - Death magic

MANA
----
Casting spells consumes mana. Your mana pool is:
  10 + (INT * 5)

Mana regenerates over time when not in combat:
  1 + (WIS / 3) per tick

SPELL FAILURE
-------------
Wearing armor can cause spells to fail (mana still consumed):
  None/Robes: 0%
  Light armor: 10%
  Medium armor: 30%
  Heavy armor: 60%

CASTING
-------
Use 'cast <spell> [target]' to cast a spell. Your effectiveness depends
on your skill in the spell's school and your INT stat.
