CORPSES
=======

When a creature dies, it leaves behind a corpse containing all of its
inventory and equipped items.

LOOTING
-------
Use 'get <item> from corpse' to retrieve items from a corpse before it
decays. Corpses can be searched like containers.

DECAY TIMES
-----------
Corpses decay over time, dropping their contents to the floor:
  Monster corpses: 5 minutes
  Player corpses:  1 hour

When a corpse decays while in a room, all remaining items drop to the
floor. If a corpse is in someone's inventory (you picked it up), it
won't decay until dropped.

BURYING
-------
Use 'bury' or 'bury <corpse>' to bury a corpse. All items inside it are
destroyed - be sure to loot anything valuable first!

PLAYER DEATH
------------
When you die:
  1. All your equipment and inventory go into your corpse
  2. You are sent to the netherworld
  3. Type 'resurrect' in the netherworld to return to the living
  4. Your corpse remains for 1 hour - plenty of time to retrieve gear
  5. Go back to where you died and loot your corpse
