                            COMBAT - How Fighting Works
===============================================================================

STARTING COMBAT
---------------
To attack a monster or player, type:
  attack <target>

Example: attack rat, attack orc, attack wolf

COMBAT MECHANICS
----------------
Once combat starts, it proceeds automatically in rounds (every 2 seconds):

1. HIT CHANCE
   Your chance to hit is calculated as:
   50% + (your DEX * 3) - (target AGI * 2) - (intoxication / 2)

   - Higher DEX improves your accuracy
   - Target's AGI makes them harder to hit
   - Being drunk reduces your accuracy
   - Hit chance is always between 5% and 95%

2. DAMAGE
   When you hit, damage is calculated as:
   Weapon damage + (STR / 2)

   If you have no weapon (unarmed):
   1 + (STR / 3) + (STR / 2)

   - Stronger characters deal more damage
   - Better weapons deal more damage

3. ARMOR
   The target's armor reduces incoming damage:
   Actual damage = Your damage - Target's total armor

   - You always deal at least 1 damage
   - Armor from all equipped pieces adds up

ENDING COMBAT
-------------
Combat ends when:
  - You or your opponent reaches 0 HP (death)
  - You flee by moving to another room

MONSTER BEHAVIOR
----------------
Some monsters are AGGRESSIVE - they attack you on sight!
  - Wolves and Orcs are aggressive
  - Rats, Spiders, and Snakes are passive (you must attack first)

HEALTH REGENERATION
-------------------
When NOT in combat:
  - You regenerate 1 HP every 2 seconds
  - Being intoxicated speeds up regeneration

TIPS
----
  - Check your HP frequently during combat
  - Equip the best weapon and armor you can find
  - Raise your STR for more damage, DEX for accuracy
  - Fight easier monsters first to gain experience
  - Run away if you're about to die!
