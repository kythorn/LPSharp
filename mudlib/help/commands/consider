CONSIDER
========

Usage: consider <target>

Evaluate how a fight against a target would go. This takes into account
your stats, skills, equipment, HP, and the target's combat abilities.

Examples:
  consider wolf
  consider orc

Ratings (from easiest to hardest):
  "is a complete pushover"
  "looks like easy prey"
  "should be a comfortable fight"
  "looks like a fair challenge"
  "is evenly matched with you"
  "looks like a tough fight"
  "would be very dangerous to fight"
  "would probably kill you"
  "would annihilate you"

The rating is based on expected damage per round and how many rounds
each side would need to defeat the other.
