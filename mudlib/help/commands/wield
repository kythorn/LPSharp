WIELD - Equip a weapon
======================

Usage: wield <weapon>

Equips a weapon from your inventory. Having a weapon equipped increases
your damage in combat.

Examples:
  wield sword
  wield tooth

Notes:
  - You can only wield one weapon at a time
  - Wielding a new weapon automatically unwields the old one
  - The item must be a weapon (not armor or other items)
  - Your damage = weapon damage + (STR / 2)
