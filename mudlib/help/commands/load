LOAD (Wizard Command)
=====================

Usage: load <path>

Load or reload an LPC file. This is useful for testing changes to code
without restarting the server.

Arguments:
  <path>  - The path to the LPC file (e.g., /world/rooms/town/square)

Examples:
  load /world/rooms/town/square      - Load/reload the town square
  load /std/room                     - Reload the base room class

Notes:
  - Requires Wizard or higher access level
  - The path should not include the .c extension
  - Reloading a file updates its code but existing clones keep old code
  - Use 'update' to refresh the current room's code
