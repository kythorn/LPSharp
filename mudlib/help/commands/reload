RELOAD
======

Usage: reload

Hot-reload all LPC files that have changed since they were last loaded.
This updates blueprints and all their clones with the new code without
requiring a server restart.

The reload checks file modification times and recompiles any .c files
that are newer than their loaded blueprints. New variables added to
objects are automatically initialized on existing clones.

Admin command.
