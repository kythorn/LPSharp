SPELLS
======

Usage: spells

Display a list of spells you have learned, along with their mana cost,
required school, and minimum skill level.

Spells are learned by joining guilds that teach magic. Each spell belongs
to a magic school (evocation, abjuration, etc.) and scales with your skill
in that school.

Example output:
  === Known Spells ===
  Fireball       [Evocation 10]    Cost: 15 mana
  Magic Missile  [Evocation 1]     Cost: 5 mana
  Heal           [Abjuration 5]    Cost: 10 mana
